# Missionaries-Cannibals-Interactive-Solution
This repository provides an interactive Python solution to the classic Missionaries and Cannibals problem. In this puzzle, the goal is to transport all the missionaries and cannibals across a river using a boat, without violating the constraints that could lead to cannibals outnumbering missionaries on either bank.
